# FullStackPizzaOrderService
Capstone Project for the Tech Academy C# Course

This project contains two components:

First, a front end pizza ordering template must be developed for customers to select the size, crust and toppings on their pizza.

Second, when the order is submitted, it must appear on an Order Management List that employees will use to monitor incoming orders.  Once orders have been completed, the employee will have the ability to press a "Complete" button and the order will be removed from the Order Management List, but not from the database.
